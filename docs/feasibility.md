# Feasibility and finding register

Date: 2026-09-20. Source inspected: local Jellyfin Web `v12.1`, `fae41f33eb7cd636a9ef68984adb82bb247a6e1b`.

## Revised accepted scope

The user accepted a different local experiment from the original pagination scan:

- Gamma Jump defaults `autoDisablePagination` to `true`, setting the signed-in user's browser/origin-local Library page size to `0` once and reloading once.
- Jellyfin natively loads/renders the complete current Movies result.
- The enhancement intercepts a supported alphabet click and scrolls among those cards.
- Full-library browser cost is accepted for investigation, but has not passed performance testing.

This does not establish a continuously scrollable Plex-style experience, a general Injector rollout, or compatibility beyond the specified Web version.

## Source-verified feasibility

`LibraryPreferences.tsx:25-43` exposes `libraryPageSize`; `en-us.json:819-820` documents zero as disabling pagination and warns of bugs/reduced performance. `userSettings.js:105-134,517-527` passes its current user ID to `appSettings`, and `appSettings.js:6-11,263-273` stores the client-local value under `<userId>-libraryPageSize`; missing values default to 100. `ServerConnections.js:92-99` exposes the active client as `window.ApiClient`, whose public `getCurrentUserId()` is used by Dashboard. `utils/items.ts:122-126` turns zero into an omitted request limit. `useFetchItems.ts:330-347` still passes `StartIndex`, so preference configuration alone cannot prove the first query slice.

For Movies, `useLibrary.tsx:48-59` and `utils/settings.ts:30-32` yield public local-storage key `movies - <parentId>`. `LibraryPage.tsx:13-38` assigns `#moviesPage`; `ItemsView.tsx:186-210` renders Loading while pending, then Cards or `NoItemsMessage`; `AlphabetPicker.tsx:37-88` supplies the native MUI picker. These facts justify the fail-closed support/readiness model in [architecture.md](architecture.md), not a claim that the browser’s served DOM has passed it.

## R1–R6

| ID | Current status | Evidence and remaining closure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Accepted for revised limited scope | On 2026-09-20 the user accepted page size zero / native full-result rendering. The old visible page-scanning scope is historical only. Performance and actual continuous-library behavior are not validated. |
| R2 | Resolved in local design; browser evidence open | No paging remains. With `limit` omitted and explicit `StartIndex: 0`, the algorithm inspects the first matching card in one rendered constrained result. Browser network and multi-thousand-card verification remain required. |
| R3 | Resolved in local design; browser evidence open | Empty DOM is rejected. Readiness requires no pending signal and cards or Jellyfin's actual no-items message. A disabled pager is no longer relevant. Delayed loading and cache/placeholder behavior need browser proof. |
| R4 | Resolved in local design; browser evidence open | Query identity comes from the route plus public Movies settings; a native alphabet clear is the sole expected excluded setting change. Latest-request tokens prevent stale completion. Event ordering and filter/search mutations need browser proof. |
| R5 | Superseded | Page navigation/restoration budgets are removed because the implementation never pages. Bounded cancellable readiness and whole-request timeouts remain. |
| R6 | Resolved in local design; semantic validation open | Matching is literal `data-prefix.startsWith(letter)` with no passed-letter exit. Custom sort names, punctuation, accent, and non-Latin semantics must be observed in the target browser/library. |

## Fail-closed prerequisites

The enhancement retains native behavior when the signed-in identity is unavailable/ambiguous; user-local storage or its matching backup fails; explicit StartIndex is missing/nonzero; the Movies settings key cannot be read; grid/ascending SortName is absent; the picker/page is ambiguous; the toolbar/card counts do not prove a complete rendered result; or a result has not become ready. It never adjusts server settings. It changes only the active user's client-local page-size preference, once per session unless the user explicitly restores it.

Small libraries and constrained results of 100 or fewer are supported only when the numeric toolbar total exactly equals the rendered Movie-card count and no query is pending. A count above 100 is not substitute evidence. An initial native alphabet subset remains native until an alphabet-clear result for that same query has been proven in the current page session.

### 2026-09-21 served-browser prerequisite result

The authorized Jellyfin 12.1 browser session later confirmed a saved-zero visual state with one `#moviesPage`, one 27-button picker, grid/ascending SortName, explicit `StartIndex: 0`, toolbar total `1,538`, and exactly `1,538` rendered Movie cards. The injected probe still saw no unprefixed `libraryPageSize` key. That was a real defect in the old implementation, not absence of the client-local preference: source shows the active-user-prefixed key. The corrected local code uses the verified key solely for guarded configuration and uses toolbar/card equality for arming. It still needs a fresh served-browser test after the Injector entry is manually updated. Details are in [testing.md](testing.md).

## Decision

The local code is suitable for review and a controlled temporary-browser trial. That trial will change the signed-in user's browser/origin-local library page-size setting and reload once; a console copy must be pasted again afterward. It is not ready for general JavaScript Injector installation: automatic preference application/restoration, served-DOM gating, native-clear timing, network parameters, performance, and Enhanced coexistence still need evidence.

## Server-plugin delivery finding — 2026-09-21

Jellyfin Server 12.1's published `Jellyfin.Controller` and `Jellyfin.Model` projects identify package version `12.1.0` and target `net10.0`. The official plugin template establishes `BasePlugin<TConfiguration>`, `IHasWebPages`, embedded configuration pages, controller endpoints, and `IPluginServiceRegistrator` as supported plugin surfaces. A stock ASP.NET Core `IStartupFilter` is the available route for in-memory index transformation; Jellyfin does not provide a dedicated public Web-file transformation API.

The local plugin implementation uses that narrow middleware route and embeds the authoritative browser source at build time. Before the later SDK installation it had not been built locally, loaded into Jellyfin, or validated with the served 12.1 index path. No server, Injector setting, or source checkout was modified.

### Build evidence update — 2026-09-21

The local .NET 10 SDK `10.0.401` subsequently restored and built `Jellyfin.Plugin.GammaJump` against the 12.1.0 packages with zero warnings/errors. Its xUnit suite passed 5/5 after adding test-only runtime package references; the production project still excludes those server-provided runtime assets. This closes only compile-time and focused pure-logic evidence. Plugin loading, controller discovery, the static-file response-body path, cache/compression behavior, and Jellyfin Enhanced/File Transformation coexistence remain open until an approved disposable-server test.

### Review-finding correction update — 2026-09-21

The XML-incompatible `Dictionary<Guid, bool>` was replaced with XML-compatible `LibrarySelectionRecord` values, and an actual `XmlSerializer` default/explicit-selection round trip passes. Collection GUIDs are now normalized to lower-case unhyphenated form at server, dashboard, and browser boundaries; JavaScript tests cover a realistic route/server spelling pair and a mismatch. The injection middleware now derives a configured-base prefix from the raw early-pipeline Web index path, with middleware (not helper-only) tests for root hosting, `/jellyfin` hosting, duplicate prevention, and API/media pass-through.

Target-pipeline evidence was rechecked against the official Jellyfin Server `v12.1` tag `ee91c75e777da41a9c4f4855e70adc604fbf2ef8`: `Jellyfin.Server/Startup.cs` calls `app.Map(config.BaseUrl, mainApp => ...)`, and the mapped branch registers `UseDefaultFiles` and `UseStaticFiles` with `RequestPath = "/web"`. Since Gamma Jump's startup filter wraps that configure delegate, its outer middleware sees `/jellyfin/web/index.html` before the mapped branch reduces it to `/web/index.html`; deriving the prefix from the narrow Web-index suffix produces the correct same-origin script/config URLs. This is source and middleware-test evidence, not a served-server result.

Library discovery uses Jellyfin's supported `ILibraryManager.GetVirtualFolders()` surface and maps valid `VirtualFolderInfo.ItemId` values to stable GUID-backed selection records under the same synchronization used for administrator saves. Invalid or missing virtual-folder IDs are skipped with a warning rather than breaking settings discovery. Automated transition tests cover initial default enablement, a new library after an automatic-policy change, rename/reload persistence, unsupported exclusion, harmless stale selections, and virtual-folder discovery without accessing `RootFolder.VirtualChildren`. These findings are resolved at unit/test-host scope. The actual Jellyfin pipeline order, XML load through Jellyfin itself, administrator dashboard behavior, served base-URL injection, and browser/plugin compatibility remain unverified and are not resolved.

Follow-up review corrections: the administrator response now obtains each library's saved selection without applying the global enable flag, while client configuration continues to apply it. This prevents a disabled global toggle from rendering saved choices as unchecked and overwriting them on a later save. Browser plugin startup now treats absent/not-ready public `ApiClient` authentication as a bounded retry condition rather than permanently adding the library to failed configuration state. The local JavaScript suite passed **30/30** after exercising this transition. Served dashboard and early-startup behavior remain unverified.

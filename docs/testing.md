# Gamma Jump test record

Date: 2026-09-20 to 2026-09-23. Prototype commit under test: local working tree based on `fe5d042038912484240d77b530b1c6e136e51c97`; this uncommitted rework has **not** been committed or pushed.

Browser/session: authorized Codex in-app browser (its Chromium version was not exposed by the available test surface); Jellyfin Server/Web identified in the UI as Grogpool 12.1; Jellyfin Enhanced 12.7.0.0-639247594740000000 was active. The user authorized a temporary authenticated JavaScript Injector script named `AJ test`. The diagnostic script used to inspect prerequisites is disabled again. No credentials, tokens, or HAR were recorded.

## Expanded compatible-library registry — 2026-09-23

The current local change expands the source-backed registry beyond Movies and
Shows. Deterministic tests exercise exact route/page/settings/card-type
contracts for Movies, Shows, Books/Audiobooks, built-in Collections, Home
Videos and its Photo/Photo Album/Video tabs, Mixed, Music albums, Music Videos,
and top-level Playlists. They also exercise absent first-use settings, native
alphabet clearing, heterogeneous/missing-prefix rejection, the separate
Collections configuration scope, and native fallbacks for Live TV, songs,
suggestions, and detail pages.

`ILibraryManager.GetVirtualFolders()` test-host coverage now maps Books and
Home Videos from real `VirtualFolderInfo` shapes, skips malformed IDs, and
verifies all source-backed collection types synchronize selection state while
Live TV and arbitrary unsupported types stay disabled. The built-in Collections
toggle is XML round-trip tested separately from folder IDs. These are automated
local results, not a served dashboard or browser result.

On 2026-09-23, `node --check src/gamma-jump.js` passed and the full Node suite
passed **88/88**. The Release C# test suite passed **24/24**. The Release
production build succeeded; its sole `NU1900` warning was NuGet vulnerability
metadata retrieval blocked by this environment, not a compiler warning or test
failure. `node scripts/validate-release-abi.js` confirmed the 12.1.0.0 release
ABI metadata, and `git diff --check` passed. No Jellyfin server, browser tab,
dashboard, Injector entry, installation, restart, commit, push, or publication
was performed for this expansion.

### Required browser checks for this expansion (not yet run)

1. In **Collections**, enable its separate dashboard setting, use the
   Collections and Favorites tabs in ascending Name grid view, and verify the
   authenticated client-config request uses `scope=collections` without a
   `libraryId`.
2. In an **Audiobooks/Books** folder, test Folders and Books with mixed
   `Folder`/`AudioBook`/`Book` cards, then Collections/Favorites where present.
   Confirm the rendered total equals every allowed card and a native alphabet
   parameter is absent during a jump.
3. In the downloaded **YouTube** library, record its configured collection type
   instead of its name. Test only the corresponding supported grid (commonly
   Home Videos, Mixed, Movies, or Music Videos); verify a type mismatch leaves
   the native picker intact.
4. Navigate between supported tabs/libraries during a pending jump, then enter
   Live TV, a song list, a suggestion page, a detail page, and a standalone
   Photos library. Confirm pending work cancels and all excluded pages remain
   native.

## Stateless alphabet commands — 2026-09-22

The current code changes Gamma Jump from its earlier persistent-selection behavior to stateless, Plex-like commands: each `A`–`Z` activation repeats that letter's jump, no Gamma Jump marker or `aria-current` state remains, and only `#` returns to the beginning. The served-browser observations below predate this change and are retained as historical evidence only; **the new stateless behavior has not yet been run in a live browser**.

Automated validation on 2026-09-22 passed `node --check src/gamma-jump.js` and **38/38** focused JavaScript tests. The added production-path checks cover repeated M clicks as independent intercepted jumps, `#` returning to top after a letter jump, absence of Gamma Jump marker/`aria-current` state across the picker, untouched native `aria-pressed`, latest-request-wins scrolling, query cancellation, detach feedback/listener cleanup, and runtime update recovery. `dotnet build` completed with 0 warnings/errors and `dotnet test` passed **11/11**. The added C# regressions supply 12.1 `VirtualFolderInfo` values through `ILibraryManager.GetVirtualFolders()`, verify valid Movies mapping and invalid-ID skips, throw if discovery reads `RootFolder`, and verify runtime fingerprint/script URL behavior. These are local deterministic results, not browser validation.

The repository `global.json` explicitly selects `Microsoft.Testing.Platform` for .NET 10 `dotnet test`. This is required because the test project's MTP v2 dependency no longer supports the SDK's legacy VSTest target. On 2026-09-22, the CI-equivalent `dotnet test ... --configuration Release --no-build --no-restore` command passed **11/11** locally with .NET SDK `10.0.401`. The preceding local build emitted two `NU1900` warnings only because this environment could not reach NuGet's vulnerability-data service; it produced no build errors.

### Update-recovery implementation — 2026-09-22

The plugin now exposes a no-store runtime identity containing a per-process ID,
embedded-script SHA-256 fingerprint, and plugin version. Bootstrap script URLs
carry that fingerprint. Server-side tests cover stable fingerprints for equal
script bytes, changed fingerprints/URLs for changed bytes, and root/base-URL
markup. Browser recovery is plugin-only and event/focus/visibility driven; it
does not poll continuously. Jellyfin Web v12.1 source uses a module-scoped
playback manager, so this implementation defers to a manual accessible refresh
notice unless a host exposes the verified `isPlayingLocally` API. No served
server/browser update-recovery run has been performed.

### Recovery lifecycle and release-metadata follow-up — 2026-09-22

The browser production-path tests now additionally cover destruction and
reinjection while an old runtime request is unresolved; the late response
cannot create a notice, mutate the replacement, or reload. An unabortable
request timeout remains owned until it settles, preventing concurrent runtime
requests. Restart-event tests exercise the actual subscription callback and
request path through old-runtime response, unavailable server, and new runtime
for both unchanged and changed fingerprints. They also verify duplicate restart
events create one loop, delayed `ApiClient` readiness subscribes later,
replacement clients replace (rather than duplicate) the subscription, and
destroy removes it. These are deterministic fake-client tests of the shipping
functions; they do not establish a live Jellyfin restart.

`node scripts/validate-release-abi.js` passed and derives `12.1.0.0` from the
pinned `Jellyfin.Controller`/`Jellyfin.Model` `12.1.0` references. It checks
only the current release workflow's generated `TARGET_ABI`; it deliberately
does not compare or rewrite historical manifest entries, which must retain the
ABI each published release was built for. The existing 0.2.0.0 and 0.2.1.0 tags
both contain those 12.1.0 package references, so their manifest metadata was
corrected from the unsupported 12.0.0.0 claim without altering published URLs,
checksums, versions, timestamps, or ZIP assets.

### 0.3.0.0 release preparation — 2026-09-22

The local development assembly version is now `0.3.0.0`; the release workflow
continues to override it from the four-part Git tag. Documentation now states
that JellyTweaks must be set to Library Page Size `0`, or JellyTweaks/all tweaks
must be disabled—there is no per-setting unmanaged state. It also states the
first-upgrade boundary explicitly: an already-open 0.2.1.0 tab needs one manual
browser refresh after the 0.3.0.0 server restart before later update recovery
can work. Stock Jellyfin Web 12.1 remains expected to show the accessible
refresh action rather than auto-reload, because the playback manager is not a
verified public window API. On this host, `node --check` and the JavaScript
suite passed **38/38**; the ABI validator passed; and C# tests passed **11/11**.
The Release build succeeded with two `NU1900` warnings because NuGet's
vulnerability-data endpoint was unavailable, not because package restore or
compilation failed. No tag, release, installation, restart, or browser test was
performed for this preparation.

### Repository security hardening — 2026-09-22

Before enabling immutable-release-compatible repository controls, local
validation passed JavaScript syntax, **38/38** JavaScript tests, the ABI check,
and **11/11** C# tests. The Release build completed with the same transient
NuGet vulnerability-data `NU1900` warning recorded above. Workflow actions are
now SHA pinned; CodeQL and Dependabot configuration are source-controlled.
Ruleset, Actions, secret-scanning, vulnerability-reporting, and immutable
release settings require GitHub-hosted verification after this change is pushed.

The first CodeQL C# baseline run exposed a workflow configuration defect: it
initialized analysis but did not build the .NET projects, so CodeQL reported no
C# source code. The follow-up workflow adds a pinned .NET setup action and an
explicit Release build in manual CodeQL mode. Its GitHub-hosted result remains
pending until the corrective pull request is merged.

## Actually run

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pinned source inspection | Passed | Local `jellyfin-web-v12.1` is tag `v12.1` / `fae41f33eb7cd636a9ef68984adb82bb247a6e1b`. Source paths and semantics are recorded in [architecture.md](architecture.md). |
| Syntax | Passed | `node --check src/gamma-jump.js` completed on 2026-09-20. |
| Focused production-path regressions | Passed | On 2026-09-21, `node --check src/gamma-jump.js` and `node --test tests/gamma-jump.test.js` passed: 16 passed, 0 failed. A minimal fake DOM drives the actual init/configuration, backup/restore, complete-render gate (including small/pending results), confirmed native-subset gate, picker capture/native-clear, `execute`, `waitForReady`, cancellation, query-change, and detach code paths. It does not establish browser compatibility. Expected error output covers denied/malformed storage and unavailable authentication. |
| Whitespace/diff check | Passed | `git diff --check` completed on 2026-09-20 with no whitespace errors (Git printed only repository line-ending warnings). |
| Served Movies DOM | Observed | Movies rendered one `#moviesPage`, one native alphabet picker with 27 buttons, one candidate LibraryToolbar, grid cards carrying `data-prefix`, and an unfiltered total of 1,538. The normal session state was `1-100 of 1,538`, Previous disabled / Next enabled. |
| Injector delivery | Observed | A temporary authenticated probe ran only after an actual browser reload. A same-document SPA route change is not a substitute for the Injector's required browser refresh after configuration changes. |
| Saved-zero served shape | Observed | Movies showed toolbar total `1,538`, no Previous/Next pager, one picker, and `1,538` `#moviesPage .card[data-prefix][data-type="Movie"]` elements. The active injected probe nevertheless reported no unprefixed key. The old unprefixed storage assumption was wrong; a saved preference is not an arming input in any case. |
| Page-size UI location and persistence | Observed | The served UI is **User Menu → Settings → Display → Libraries → Library page size**. It showed `100` and has a separate Save button. Source now verifies the actual client-local key is `<activeUserId>-libraryPageSize`; the updated prototype writes that key only as the requested automatic setup, then reloads once. This behavior remains untested in the served browser. |
| Automatic preference configuration and restoration | Passed locally | Production-path tests cover missing, explicit `100`/`250`, already-zero, multiple-user keys, unavailable authentication, malformed backup, denied storage, reinjection, user switching, one reload maximum, restoration of explicit and absent values, and no immediate reapply after restore. No live browser preference changed for these tests. |
| A click with the stale Injector copy | Failed — implementation defect found | In the saved-zero state, the existing `AJ test` copy still used the `libraryPageSize` guard. Clicking A applied Jellyfin's native alphabet filter (toolbar/card count became 73; native A was pressed; no Gamma Jump feedback or marker). Local code now uses the observed complete-render proof instead. JavaScript Injector's Import accepts exported JSON, not a standalone `.js`, so its old entry was not overwritten automatically. |
| Injector entry recovery | Resolved for this temporary session | The user manually pasted the corrected local script into `AJ test`, saved it, and returned to Movies. Served-DOM inspection found a 40,306-character `AJ test` script containing both `hasCompleteUnpaginatedResult` and `hasPotentialUnpaginatedResult`, with neither diagnostic-probe text nor a pre-existing Gamma Jump marker. This establishes delivery for this browser session only; it does not validate persistence or authorize deployment. |
| Historical A jump on the fully rendered library | Passed — prior selection model | With toolbar total/card count `1,538`, clicking A left all `1,538` cards in the DOM, native `aria-pressed` for A at `false`, and added Gamma Jump's then-existing A marker. Feedback read `First A title.` The first literal `data-prefix.startsWith('A')` card was `About Time` (`data-prefix="ABO"`), positioned at document top 1,851 after the click; the viewport was scrolled to 1,743 so it sat below the sticky header. |
| Historical K regression jump on the fully rendered library | Passed — prior selection model | Clicking K retained all `1,538` cards and native K `aria-pressed="false"`, marked K, and reported `First K title.` After the configured smooth-scroll animation settled (about five seconds for this distance), the first matching card, `K-19: The Widowmaker` (`data-prefix="K-1"`), was at viewport top 108. |
| Historical M and Z jumps on the fully rendered library | Passed — prior selection model | M and Z each retained all `1,538` cards and native pressed state `false`, marked only the requested enhancement letter, and announced its first title. M reached `M3GAN` (`M3G`) at viewport top 108. Z reached `Zathura: A Space Adventure` (`ZAT`) at viewport top 311; its position is lower because the document cannot scroll beyond the final row. |
| Historical `#` and repeated-letter behavior | Passed — superseded behavior | From selected Z, `#` cleared Gamma Jump's marker, retained all cards/native `#` state, announced `At the beginning.`, and reached `scrollY=0`. After selecting A (`scrollY=1,743`), clicking A again returned to `scrollY=0`. The new implementation deliberately changes that repeated-letter result. |

The controlled browser run has established two enhancement-controlled clicks in the saved-zero shape. It has **not** yet captured Network request parameters, validated all requested scenarios, or measured sustained performance. Earlier 100-item pagination observations cannot validate the unpaginated architecture.

## Required controlled browser run

Record Server version, served Web asset/version, browser/version, JavaScript Injector version/state, Jellyfin Enhanced version/state, active-user-prefixed page-size key, `movies - <parentId>` settings, and the exact local commit or working-tree diff. Do not save credentials, tokens, or unsanitized HAR files.

| Scenario | Evidence needed | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arm prerequisite | Page size zero, explicit StartIndex zero, grid, ascending SortName, and `#moviesPage` exist; `window.__gammaJumpPrototypeV1` is present after temporary console injection. | Partially observed: served `AJ test` has the corrected gate and intercepted A/K in the full-rendered grid; the isolated-window test surface could not read the page global, and explicit StartIndex/network evidence remains untested. |
| Automatic setup / reload / restore | Start from a nonzero and an absent active-user preference in a disposable browser profile. Confirm only that user's prefixed key changes, one reload occurs, the console script must be re-pasted, and `restorePagination()` restores/removes the original key after the injector is disabled. | Not run in a served browser; this action changes the signed-in user's browser/origin-local preference. |
| Page-size zero request | DevTools Network shows no item `limit`, `startIndex=0`, preserved non-alphabet filters, and no alphabet parameter during an enhancement jump. | Not run |
| Page-one / M / Z | A page-one letter, unloaded M, and Z each scroll to the first rendered matching card without native alphabet state. | Passed for the full unfiltered rendered library: A, M, and Z reached their first literal prefix matches with native state off. This was no longer a paged/unloaded scenario, so it does not test pagination or delayed rendering. |
| Roughly 1,500 titles and rapid scrolling | Record load time, card count/total, scrolling responsiveness, memory/CPU symptoms, and browser recovery. Do not call it acceptable without observed results. | Not run |
| Stateless commands: repeated letter and `#` | Click M twice while scrolled down: both clicks jump to the first M with no Gamma Jump marker/`aria-current` and native `aria-pressed` unchanged. Then click `#`: it reaches top and announces `At the beginning.`. | Not run in a browser after the 2026-09-22 interaction change; prior selected-letter reset is historical only. |
| Native clear | Start with an active native alphabet, including a same-card result; verify ordinary clear, replacement readiness, and retained non-alphabet filters. | Not run in the browser. The newest local source permits a native subset only after the same alphabet-clear query was observed as complete; deterministic coverage passes. The currently served `AJ test` predates this change, so paste the latest source, save, reload, then test it. |
| Delayed load + A → Z → M | Artificially throttle if safely available; only M may finish and no native letter filter may slip through while cards are absent. | Not run |
| Cancel / Escape | Cancel during loading and confirm the status no longer appears busy. | Not run |
| Query/route changes | Change filter, search, sort, page size, and navigate away during load. Work must cancel and the changed query must not receive a stale scroll or altered native alphabet state. | Not run |
| Unsupported behavior | List view, descending/non-SortName sort, nonzero StartIndex, identity/storage failure, and incomplete/pending results retain native picker behavior. | Not run |
| Missing / empty | Missing letter only reports after ready result; empty result uses the real no-items message; no false result during loading/failure. | Not run |
| Re-injection / SPA / destroy | Repeat injection, Movies → detail → Movies, then `destroy('testing complete')`, refresh, and verify native picker and Gamma Jump feedback/listener cleanup without altered native alphabet state. | Not run |
| Coexistence | Playback, card click/selection, context menu, keyboard picker activation, sticky headers, reduced motion, and Jellyfin Enhanced enabled/disabled. | Not run |

## Exact manual procedure

1. Use a disposable or explicitly authorized temporary browser profile. This test writes the active user's browser/origin-local Library page-size preference and reloads once; it does not change the Jellyfin server.
2. In DevTools, paste the local [src/gamma-jump.js](../src/gamma-jump.js). Record the active-user prefixed key and its previous value/absence before pasting. The first run may reload; paste the console script again afterward, then set `window.__gammaJumpPrototypeV1.config.debug = true` and verify the instance exists.
3. Open Movies with ascending Name/SortName grid view, clear native alphabet, and record the toolbar/card counts. Confirm all constrained results have rendered before proceeding.
4. Run the table above while observing Network. Record sanitized request URLs/parameters and outcomes here immediately.
5. To restore, first disable/remove the Injector entry or stop re-pasting the console script. Run `window.__gammaJumpPrototypeV1?.restorePagination()`, then `window.__gammaJumpPrototypeV1?.destroy('testing complete')`, and refresh manually.

## Shows extension — 2026-09-21

Added modern Shows main-tab support using the pinned v12.1 LibraryRoutes (/tv, CollectionType.Tvshows, LibraryTab.Series), LibraryPage (#tvshowsPage), and useCurrentTab/getDefaultViewIndex semantics. View settings are series - <parentId>; cards are data-type="Series". Explicit nonzero tabs and non-Series saved landing views stay native. Local tests cover Series jumping and tab/config opt-outs alongside the Movies suite. Live Shows testing remains pending; no Injector entry was changed by this implementation.

## First-navigation activation fix — 2026-09-21

User reports full results but native filtering on first navigation, with reload restoring Gamma Jump. A local production-path regression reproduced a missed attachment when cards mount before the external toolbar count settles. The mount observer now includes toolbar/count insertion and text changes, and a narrowly filtered document capture listener attempts synchronous attachment on the first supported picker click. It does not suppress unrelated or unsupported clicks. Movies/Shows late-count tests and first-click recovery/cleanup pass locally; the exact live-session cause and fresh-session behavior still require browser verification.

## First-click ownership follow-up — 2026-09-21

User reports the first click still applies native filtering, while a second works. The prior mount repair did not cover a picker clicked before complete-result proof was available. A verified active-user page-size-zero preference now permits owning/queuing a click in a supported view while readiness is pending. It is not completeness evidence: actual jumping and missing-letter feedback now require non-pending cards exactly matching the toolbar total. The # shortcut uses the same readiness gate. New production-path tests cover a first K click during loading for both Movies and Shows, plus rejection of partial results. Live confirmation is still pending.

## First-use settings correction — 2026-09-21

The user supplied before/after evidence: the Movies view-settings key did not exist before the first letter click and existed afterward. Jellyfin LibraryProvider uses getDefaultLibraryViewSettings for an absent key; Gamma Jump previously rejected it. The script now mirrors the pinned v12.1 Movies/Series defaults in memory only when the key is absent. Existing persisted settings remain authoritative; no storage write or synthetic native click is used to initialize them. Result completeness and loading checks remain required. Two production-path regressions reproduced first-click failure before the fix and pass afterward for Movies and Shows. All 26 tests pass; fresh-browser confirmation of this specific fix remains pending. Earlier timing fixes alone did not resolve the reported failure.

## Server-plugin prototype checks — 2026-09-21

Before the later SDK install, the plugin source targeted the verified Jellyfin 12.1 package/ABI version (`net10.0`, `Jellyfin.Controller`/`Jellyfin.Model` `12.1.0`) but the local `dotnet` host had no SDK. C# restore, build, and xUnit execution were therefore not run at that point. The dated update below records the completed validation.

`tests/gamma-jump.test.js` was extended and passed locally: 28 tests, 0 failures. The two added production-path checks exercise plugin-mode configuration before automatic pagination setup and a rejected configuration request that must not attach interception or use standalone defaults. Expected error output is from deliberate denied-storage and rejected-config tests.

The unexecuted .NET test project contains configuration-selection cases (new-library default, explicit-selection persistence across auto-new changes, global disable/deleted ID safety) and pure injection cases (base-path URLs, one marker only, and no `<head>` passthrough). Run, without installing anything:

```powershell
dotnet build plugin/Jellyfin.Plugin.GammaJump/Jellyfin.Plugin.GammaJump.csproj --configuration Release
dotnet test plugin/Jellyfin.Plugin.GammaJump.Tests/Jellyfin.Plugin.GammaJump.Tests.csproj --configuration Release
```

### SDK validation update — 2026-09-21

The .NET 10 SDK was subsequently installed and reported version `10.0.401`. The production project restored and built successfully with **0 warnings, 0 errors**. The xUnit project initially exposed a test-host-only issue: the production project correctly excludes Jellyfin runtime assemblies because the server supplies them, but that left the standalone test host unable to load `MediaBrowser.Model`/`MediaBrowser.Common`. Test-only direct package references were added without changing production deployment assets. After that correction, `dotnet test ... --configuration Release --no-restore` passed **5/5** in 181 ms.

The first NuGet restore needed an isolated local NuGet profile because the sandbox could not read the normal user profile; [NuGet.config](../NuGet.config) now makes the source explicit. No server process, configuration, Injector entry, plugin installation, or restart occurred. This resolves the local build/test blocker only; controller discovery, index rewriting, cache/compression behavior, and functional browser behavior are still untested.

### Focused review-finding regression update — 2026-09-21

The following automated checks were run after the configuration, ID, base-URL, and discovery corrections. This is local test-host evidence only; no Jellyfin server or browser was changed.

| Check | Result | Coverage actually executed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JavaScript syntax | Passed | `node --check src/gamma-jump.js` completed. |
| JavaScript tests | Passed | `node --test tests/gamma-jump.test.js`: **30/30** passed. Plugin-mode tests exercise the actual route/config load path with an unhyphenated route GUID, equivalent hyphenated server GUID, a genuinely different GUID rejection, and a temporarily absent `ApiClient` that becomes available before the bounded retry window expires. |
| Plugin build | Passed | `dotnet build plugin/Jellyfin.Plugin.GammaJump.Tests/Jellyfin.Plugin.GammaJump.Tests.csproj --no-restore`: **0 warnings, 0 errors** with SDK `10.0.401`. |
| C# tests | Passed | `dotnet test plugin/Jellyfin.Plugin.GammaJump.Tests/Jellyfin.Plugin.GammaJump.Tests.csproj --no-build --no-restore`: **9/9** passed. Tests execute XML serialize/deserialize round trips, discovery-policy transitions, route-ID normalization, and the actual response-body middleware for root and `/jellyfin` paths, duplicate markers, API passthrough, and media passthrough. |

Not performed: loading the plugin in Jellyfin, confirming its `IStartupFilter` order in a served 12.1 pipeline, observing actual configured-base-URL output, browser configuration-page authorization/rendering, cache/compression behavior, or any browser functional test with the plugin. Those remain required controlled-installation evidence.

The C# XML/configuration regression also asserts that a globally disabled configuration reports a saved library selection independently of runtime enablement. The administrator mapper uses that saved state, so a global-disable save/re-enable cycle does not convert existing enabled rows to disabled selections. This remains test-host evidence; the served dashboard workflow is still unperformed.

## Distribution infrastructure — 2026-09-22

Static distribution checks were completed without creating a tag, GitHub Release, manifest version entry, plugin installation, or server restart:

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repository manifest | Passed | Root `manifest.json` parsed with Node. It is a Jellyfin manifest array containing Gamma Jump metadata and an intentionally empty `versions` list; no placeholder URL or checksum was created. |
| Workflow syntax and Actions rules | Passed | Official `actionlint` 1.7.12 was downloaded to a temporary directory, verified against its published SHA-256, and passed for `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/release.yml`. |
| Packaging design | Reviewed | Release builds package only `plugin/Jellyfin.Plugin.GammaJump/bin/Release/net10.0/Jellyfin.Plugin.GammaJump.dll`. Current Release output contains that DLL plus `.deps.json`, `.pdb`, and `.xml`; the workflow's `unzip -Z1` assertions reject anything except the DLL. `Jellyfin.Controller` and `Jellyfin.Model` are runtime-excluded in the production project, and the test project is never a package input. |

The release workflow has `contents: write` only. It uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` to create/upload the release and update the default branch manifest. If branch protection blocks GitHub Actions from pushing to `main`, a maintainer must permit that narrowly scoped bot push or adjust the workflow to open a pull request; no personal token is embedded.

### Exact first controlled plugin test

1. Use a server test copy and browser profile; do not use the production server first.
2. Disable the JavaScript Injector Gamma Jump entry before testing the plugin, so duplicate delivery cannot hide an injection problem. Also note whether JellyTweaks, Jellyfin Enhanced, or File Transformation is active.
3. Build with the .NET 10 SDK, inspect the output for only plugin-owned files, then follow a separate approved install/restart action. This milestone does not authorize it.
4. After installation, request `/web/index.html` through the server and verify exactly one `gamma-jump-plugin-bootstrap` marker, base-URL-safe script/config URLs, normal HTML rendering, and no injection on an API/media request. Capture only sanitized headers; do not save tokens or HAR files.
5. Sign in as an administrator, verify actual Movies/Shows folders and their GUID-backed checkboxes, then save an enable/disable change. Refresh the browser and verify the enabled library loads config and an excluded or unsupported one retains native behavior.
6. Repeat the existing Movies/Shows functional and network checklist above. Verify `GammaJump/client-config` is authenticated, returns no inventory, and a forced request failure retains native alphabet behavior.
